      review: "From the minute I messaged photohaus till the end of our wedding day they've been a joy to work with! They made everything very seamless and beautiful with plenty of options and details that captured us and our guests. We really appreciate the photobooth and the staff that came along with it. They even made a point to get my wife and I to the booth to make sure we used it as well and no other vendor did that! We're so happy we found them!"

The setup was sleek and professional, and the attendant was friendly and attentive throughout the event. The variety of props that were included made it even so much better. It added a creative touch to our photos, making each snapshot memorable. The quality of the prints was exceptional, and our family and friends had a great time capturing all the moments together. If you want to elevate your event and create unforgettable moment, I highly recommend Photohaus for any event!"
