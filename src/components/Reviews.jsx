            From the minute I messaged photohaus till the end of our wedding day they‚Äôve been a joy to work with! They made everything very seamless and beautiful with plenty of options and details that captured us and our guests. We really appreciate the photobooth and the staff that came along with it. They even made a point to get my wife and I to the booth to make sure we used it as well and no other vendor did that! We‚Äôre so happy we found them!            </p>
